Overview:
- show a ring of particles and a planet in an 
  elliptical orbit

T1 - Binary Pair
- shows the use of BinaryPair component to 
  build a binary system of stars

T2 - Orbits
- illustrates elliptical and hyperbolic
  orbit components
- shows orbital heirarachy by adding a moon
  to the planet and using Kepler evolution for
  the moon

T3 - Collisions
- demonstrates the use of the NBodyCollision 
  script attached to the model for a planet

T4 - Particles
- shows the use of GravityParticles and the
  components to configure initial particles
  (DustRing) in an orbit

T5 - Orbit Prediction
- shows the use of an OrbitPredictor component
  to predict the path of a spaceship around a
  star
- provides simple spaceship controls to fire an
  the engine and see the change in the orbit

Units - Earth Orbit
- shows the use of scaling selection in the 
  GravityEngine and the use of real-world values
  for objects orbiting Earth

Scaling - ISS
- demonstration of the orbit of the International
  Space station

Solar System Inner
- uses the SolarSystemBuilder class and Solar
  units to create a scene with the planets from
  the inner solar system at a specific data
